# RESTful-API-Catalog_Product

Hello this is my project mode of solving this problem.

I've used Php, Phpmyadmin, and Postman to read the requests and post them in Json.

The 'php_project_catalog' folder it is the first alternative which have the Task1.

The next folder, 'php_project_catalog_update' contain both, first and second Tasks
For protection i've used JWT.

I have attached the datebase also, 'catalog_product'

And for the last Task, I don't know how to put it in the Api so I've attached the 'login_limit_rate.php' to show you 
how I think the problem.
